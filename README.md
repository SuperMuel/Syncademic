The goal of this service is to provide students with a seamless and user-friendly way to integrate
their university schedules into their Google Calendars. By allowing users to simply provide the URL
of their university's schedule, the service takes care of automatically and regularly updating the 
user's Google Calendar with their class schedules in the background, without requiring any further 
user interaction.


This approach offers several key benefits:

1. **Improved user experience**: Students can leverage the familiar and visually appealing interface of Google Calendar, accessible across multiple platforms, instead of relying on the often cumbersome and outdated scheduling tools provided by their universities.

2. **Comprehensive view**: With their university schedule seamlessly synchronized to their Google Calendar, students can view and manage all their commitments, whether academic, personal, or professional, in one convenient location. This comprehensive view allows for better planning and time management, and avoid conflicts. 

3. **Automation and convenience**: Once the schedule URL is provided, the service handles the entire process of fetching, parsing, and synchronizing the schedule data with the user's Google Calendar. Our service does not add any complexity. 

4. **Real time updates** : Unlike other scheduling tools that may take hours or even days to reflect changes, our solution can automatically update users' calendars at an unrestricted rate. This ensures that any modifications to class times or locations are promptly reflected, preventing students from missing important schedule changes. Moreover, if one student triggers an update after becoming aware of a timetable alteration, all other users benefit from the change being immediately propagated to their calendars, fostering a synchronized and up-to-date experience across the entire user base.

5. **Customization and personalization**: The service aims to provide options for customizing the appearance and organization of the schedule events within Google Calendar, such as color-coding based on courses or improving event titles for better readability.

6. **Multiple time schedules**: This service greatly benefits students pursuing multiple degrees or attending different institutions by consolidating various schedules into a single, unified Google Calendar view. It enables these students to effortlessly manage and visualize all their commitments in one place and identifying conflicts, simplifying the process of organizing their academic lives.
